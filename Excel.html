				<h2>Excel</h2>
					<p>Microsoft Excel uses spreadsheets to organize numbers or data and (from small to large companies) it is used in all business functions. We will mainly be using excel to generate client lists from salesforce in order to present and edit your list of clients in an organized fashion.</p>
					<p>Though there are many more ways to do this, here is an example of a simple client list generated from salesforce and edited in Excel.</p>
					<img src="Images\Excel.PNG" alt="Excel" class="responsive" width="1500" height="800" id="ExcelImg">
					<p>As pictured, this spread sheet is color coded to help you keep track of which client’s you are not reaching out to, have already reached out to, etc. In this case:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Green means the client has expressed interest in your offering so you can mark that client as green to help you visually keep track of that client while you create some reminders or tasks in salesforce or outlook to remind yourself to continue following up with that client.</li>
						<li>Blue simply means you have not heard back from the client yet so you should continue to follow up at an appropriate time.</li>
						<li>Purple means you are not going to contact them yet because their project timing isn’t ideal or various other factors.</li>
						<li>Red means you have identified the client as a non-target account because their project might not be a fit for our capabilities.</li>
						<li>Gold means you have already closed this client and you don’t need to prospect them anymore.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here is a video where I do a break down on how to use excel to organize your client list even further.</p>
