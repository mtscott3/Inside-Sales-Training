	#Inside-Sales-Training
			
Hello sales super stars! My name is Matthew Taylor Scott, and I'm a sales professional 
with a B.S. in Biology and a Master of Business Administration that I achieved during my 5 years of 
working for Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the largest Contract Development & Manufacturing Organizations. 
I gained knowledge in the Pharma & Biotech manufacturing industry delivering results where I exceeded my sales 
targets and was recognized for creating training programs to train a total of 8 new hires. This resulted in management
adding these modules to the company’s New Hire Onboarding training process.
	That said, I’ve utilized my software enginnering skills to develop this website hosting these sales training 
programs for future new hires to learn these skills.
	Practice the content on this website and you will be on your way to becoming an inside sales master of pharma services.
	Happy Hunting!
